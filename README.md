## Command Line Exercises

Exercises file contains some tasks. So one can practise in order to get more familiar and comfortable with commands. 

Also encourage to search and learn more if you do not know how to do it. 

## Exercises on Rails Code Base

To make things easier, some tasks tell you to work on specific files. 
Already having lots of file and folders avaliable on the system will make exercises more powerful.

The source code for Rails can easily be downloaded from [GitHub](http://github.com) using [Git](http://git-scm.com/).

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/rails/rails.git
```
If you donâ€™t have Git installed, which you should,
you can download the zip of the Rails source code at https://github.com/rails/rails/archive/master.zip.

This idea is taken from [these online book](http://conqueringthecommandline.com/book/).
